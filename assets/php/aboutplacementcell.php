<h1 style="font-weight:bold">About Us</h1>
                <p>The placement cell P.G.D.A.V. serves as an interface between the
students and the corporate world. Apart from bringing various
companies to the campus, the placement cell also organizes talks,
study abroad seminars, internship opportunities and workshops
for the collective student body.
                <br><br>
                In doing so, we ensure that we fulfil our primary focus of providing
a helping hand to students in their initial step into the world of
work, thereby creating a legacy.
In our desire to be the best we have always believed in building
everlasting bonds with our corporate partners. Excellence they
say flows beyond boundaries and we at P.G.D.A.V. College believe
that the journey has just begun as we strive to scale new heights
and in the process give a push start to career of the students<br><br>
                Some of the companies which have recruited our students in the
recent past are Ernst and Young, Royal Bank of Scotland, Aon
Hewitt, British Telecon, L & T, Genpact, ICICI Prudential, IBM
Concentrix, Limetray and Oberoi Hotels.
                <br><br>The year 2017 saw the Placement Cell host its first ever internship
fair with the aim of providing students and companies a platform
for mutual growth. The Internship Fair was held with the purpose
of inviting firms to hire summer interns. The cell plans to hold two
such fairs every year as at P.G.D.A.V we believe that learning inside
the classroom is only one element of a holistic / well â€“rounded
and complete education.</p>
